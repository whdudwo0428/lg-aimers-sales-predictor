"""Wrapper for the FedFormer architecture used in the LGÂ Aimers pipeline.

For the purposes of this example project, we define a simple linear
model that serves as a placeholder.  In a full implementation you
should dynamically import the upstream FedFormer implementation
present in the ``models/FEDformer`` directory and construct it here.

This wrapper exposes a single class ``ForecastModel`` with a PyTorch
interface: it accepts an input tensor of shape ``(batch, seq_len,
num_features)`` and returns a prediction tensor of shape ``(batch,
forecast_horizon)``.  You can replace the internals of this class
with any architecture of your choosing.
